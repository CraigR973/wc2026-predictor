"""Auto result-fetch job (Phase 5.3).

Runs every 5 minutes (driven by the APScheduler IntervalTrigger registered
in `src.scheduler`), pulls the WC competition feed from football-data.org,
and applies a status delta per match:

* ``FINISHED`` → score + status=completed + result_source=auto (skipped if a
  manual or override result already exists).
* ``IN_PLAY``/``LIVE``/``PAUSED``/``SUSPENDED`` → status=live.
* ``POSTPONED`` → status=postponed.
* ``CANCELLED`` → status=cancelled.
* ``TIMED``/``SCHEDULED`` → kickoff drift detection — when the upstream
  ``utcDate`` differs from our ``kickoff_utc`` we update kickoff_utc and
  preserve the original. The periodic ``lock_due_matches`` job picks up
  the new kickoff naturally (no per-match job to re-register).

Each row is taken under a ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` lock so simultaneous
admin manual entry cannot race the sync. The job is idempotent — a second
run with unchanged feed is a no-op because we skip matches where
``result_source IS NOT NULL`` for FINISHED handling and avoid redundant
writes elsewhere.

After any finished result is applied we call
:func:`sync_knockout_bracket` so the next knockout round's seeded
placeholder rows resolve to real teams on this — the tournament's primary,
automatic — path. Without it R16+ fixtures stayed on ``TBD`` until an admin
manually entered a result (only the manual admin paths called it before).
The bracket resolver is idempotent and monotonic, so the call is a cheap
no-op when nothing new has settled.

On three consecutive API failures we write an ``auto_sync_failed``
notification for every admin and an ``audit_log`` row with
``action_type = sync_failed``. The counter resets on the next successful
run.
