 * Approximate live-match minute, derived from kickoff wall-clock time.
 *
 * The football-data free tier carries no match clock (it serves live full-time +
 * half-time scores only — U63), so there is no real minute to display. We estimate
 * from elapsed wall time, which deliberately can't see added time or the exact
 * half-time break. To avoid showing an impossible "104'", we render "HT" across the
 * break window, discount a nominal 15-min break in the second half, and cap at
 * "90+'". Treat the result as a rough live indicator, not the official minute.
 *
 * Returns `null` before kickoff (nothing sensible to show) or for an invalid date.
