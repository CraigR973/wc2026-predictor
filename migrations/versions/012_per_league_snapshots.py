"""multi-league: league_id on leaderboard_snapshots + invites, rewrite scoring trigger.

Revision ID: 012
Revises: 011
Create Date: 2026-05-27

Phase M2 of the multi-league rollout. Two additive columns become NOT
NULL (after a Steele backfill) so per-league fan-out works:

* ``leaderboard_snapshots.league_id`` — snapshot rows are now per
  (player, league). The new index
  ``ix_leaderboard_snapshots_league_player_time`` powers the C-2
  ``DISTINCT ON`` pattern keyed per-league; the secondary ``id DESC``
  sort still breaks ``snapshot_at`` ties from within the same
  transaction (see ``test_leaderboard_dedupes_tied_snapshot_timestamps``
  for the regression that demanded this).
* ``invites.league_id`` — invites are now scoped to the league they
  pull the claimant into.

The ``matches_score_results`` trigger function is replaced. Instead of
one snapshot per active profile it inserts one row per active
``league_memberships`` (joined to active profiles), with rank computed
via ``RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lm.league_id ORDER BY total_points DESC)``
so each league has its own standings.

Downgrade restores the migration-009 trigger shape verbatim (one
snapshot per active profile, no league fan-out) and drops the new
columns / indexes / FKs. Pre-existing snapshot rows lose their league
context on downgrade; the runbook documents that loss.
