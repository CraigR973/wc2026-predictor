"""regenerate knockout placeholder labels from their source refs.

Each R16→final knockout row stores a human-readable display label
(``home_team_placeholder`` / ``away_team_placeholder``) alongside the positional
``home_source`` / ``away_source`` refs that drive bracket resolution. On
databases seeded before the bracket sources were corrected to the real FIFA 2026
wiring (``KNOCKOUT_BRACKET`` in ``src.services.knockout_progression``), the
labels were left following a naive consecutive pairing — so an unresolved
R16/QF/SF slot could display e.g. "Winner of Match 73" while its source ref is
actually ``winner_match_74``.

This backfill recomputes the label from the source ref for every match-fed
knockout slot, restoring the invariant ``placeholder == placeholder_label(source)``
(see ``src.services.knockout_progression.placeholder_label``, which the seed
already uses — so fresh databases are unaffected; this only repairs rows seeded
earlier). It is purely a display fix: no team ids, scoring, or bracket wiring
change.

Group-fed R32 rows (``winner_group_*`` / ``runner_up_group_*`` / ``third_group_*``)
are intentionally out of scope — those slots have already resolved to real teams,
so their labels are never displayed. Idempotent: each source ref maps to the same
label on every run.
