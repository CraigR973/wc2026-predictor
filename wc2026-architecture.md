# World Cup 2026 Prediction League — Architecture & Technical Design Document

**Version 1.2 — Final | May 2026**

*A private, invite-only prediction league web application for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a group of up to 15 friends and family.*

---

## 1. Project Overview

The World Cup 2026 Prediction League is a private web application that lets a group of up to 15 players compete by predicting match scores across the entire 2026 FIFA World Cup — from the 72 group stage matches through to the Final. An admin manages the league, oversees the tournament, and intervenes when needed; results are fetched automatically from football-data.org. Players submit predictions before each match locks at kickoff, track their points on a live leaderboard, and compete across group stage, knockout rounds, and tournament specials.

**Primary Users:** One admin with full management rights, and up to 15 players with prediction and viewing access.

**Deployment:** Private, invite-only. Initially runs locally, with a clear path to cloud deployment. Built as a PWA with offline support and native push notifications.

### 1.1 Core Objectives

- Manage a complete 2026 World Cup prediction league with up to 15 players
- Support all 104 matches — 72 group stage + 32 knockout (R32 through Final)
- Lock individual match predictions automatically at kickoff time
- Score predictions in real time as results come in (2pts correct goals, 3pts correct result, 5pts exact score)
- Support tournament special predictions (winner, Golden Boot, top scoring team)
- Support round-by-round knockout bracket predictions with escalating points
- Display a live, real-time leaderboard with full points breakdown per player
- Provide group standings tables updating as results are entered
- Enable head-to-head prediction comparison between any two players
- Deliver rich player stats (accuracy %, average points, best/worst rounds)
- Send push notifications for result entries, deadline warnings, and leaderboard shifts
- Provide admin tools for result override, player management, and invite generation
- Automatically fetch match results from football-data.org every 5 minutes — no admin input required
- Trigger scoring, leaderboard updates, and push notifications automatically on result detection
- Allow admin to override any auto-fetched result with full audit trail
- Handle postponed, cancelled, and rescheduled matches gracefully
- Maintain a prediction audit trail (timestamps proving no backdating)
- Support a match schedule with dates, times, venues, and countdown timers
- Be installable as a PWA on mobile and desktop

### 1.2 Tournament Format

The 2026 FIFA World Cup uses an expanded 48-team format:

- **48 teams** across **12 groups** (A–L) of 4 teams each
- **Group stage:** Each team plays 3 matches (6 matches per group, 72 total)
- **Advancement:** Top 2 from each group (24 teams) + best 8 third-placed teams (8 teams) = 32 teams advance
- **Knockout rounds:** Round of 32 → Round of 16 → Quarter-Finals → Semi-Finals → Third Place Play-off → Final
- **Total matches:** 104 (72 group + 16 R32 + 8 R16 + 4 QF + 2 SF + 1 Third Place + 1 Final)
- **Tournament dates:** 11 June – 19 July 2026
- **Hosts:** USA, Canada, Mexico

## 3. Data Model

All tables use UUID primary keys. Common conventions:

- **`created_at TIMESTAMP`** on every table (auto-set on insert via `NOW()`)
- **`updated_at TIMESTAMP`** on all mutable tables, auto-updated by Postgres trigger
- **`deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL`** on critical tables (`profiles`, `predictions`, `matches`) for soft deletes — default queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`

### 3.1 profiles

User accounts. Players authenticate with name + PIN; no email required.

## 4. API Design

All endpoints are prefixed with **`/api/v1/`**. All endpoints return JSON with a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { "page": 1, "per_page": 20, "total": 104 },
  "errors": null
}
```

Error responses:

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [{ "code": "PREDICTION_LOCKED", "message": "This match has already kicked off.", "field": null }]
}
```

Authentication is via JWT Bearer tokens. Access tokens expire after 24 hours; refresh tokens after 30 days. Rate limits apply to auth and abuse-prone paths.

## 5. External Integrations

### 5.1 football-data.org — Automatic Result Fetching

football-data.org provides free, reliable, official-quality football data including live scores, match status, and final results for all major competitions including the FIFA World Cup.

**API details:**
- Base URL: `https://api.football-data.org/v4/`
- Authentication: API key in `X-Auth-Token` header (free tier, self-serve registration)
- Rate limit: 10 requests/minute on free tier — well within requirements
- Competition code: `WC` for FIFA World Cup
- Key endpoint: `GET /v4/competitions/WC/matches`

**Polling job (APScheduler — IntervalTrigger every 5 minutes):**

1. Job fires every 5 minutes throughout the tournament window (11 Jun – 19 Jul 2026)
2. Fetches all matches from football-data.org for the World Cup (no status filter — we need to detect status changes)
3. For each match, takes action based on the API status:
   - `SCHEDULED` → check if `kickoff_utc` matches; if not, trigger reschedule flow (§6.13)
   - `IN_PLAY` / `PAUSED` → set internal `matches.status = live`
   - `FINISHED` → enter result if not already present (auto), or update if existing auto result has changed
   - `POSTPONED` → set internal `matches.status = postponed`, log to audit, push notification
   - `CANCELLED` → set internal `matches.status = cancelled`, void predictions, log to audit
4. For every newly entered result: trigger scoring pipeline, insert `leaderboard_snapshots`, broadcast via Supabase Realtime, queue push notifications
5. Update `matches.last_synced_at` for all checked matches
6. Sync run summary stored in an in-memory status object for the admin dashboard

**Auto vs manual precedence:**
- `result_source = auto` → can be updated by future auto fetches if API corrects the score
- `result_source = manual` → admin entered manually before auto-fetch caught it; auto-fetch will not overwrite
- `result_source = override` → admin overrode an auto result; auto-fetch will not overwrite

**Admin override:**
If the API returns an incorrect result, admin can override via the result entry form. Overridden results are marked `result_source = override` and never touched by auto-sync again.

**Concurrency / race condition handling:**
The auto-fetch job and admin manual-entry both write to `matches` under a row-level lock (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`). The first to acquire wins; the second sees the updated state and either skips (auto) or proceeds as an override (admin). The admin UI surfaces a warning if the result has changed since the form was opened.

**Failure handling:**
- API unreachable (timeout, 5xx): job logs error, increments `consecutive_failure_count`, skips
- After 3 consecutive failures: push notification to admin (`auto_sync_failed`)
- Admin can trigger a manual sync at any time via `POST /admin/sync/trigger`
- Admin can fall back to manual result entry — the form is always available

**API key management:**
- Key stored as `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` environment variable
- Free tier key from football-data.org — no cost, self-serve at football-data.org/client/register

## 6. Key Features Detail

### 6.1 Scoring System

Points are awarded per prediction automatically when a result is detected (auto or manual). Calculation is performed by a Postgres function triggered on result entry and stored in `predictions.points_awarded` with a full breakdown in `predictions.points_breakdown`.

**Group stage match scoring:**

| Criteria | Points |
|---|---|
| Correct combined total goals (e.g. predicted 2-1, actual 3-0: both = 3 goals) | 2 |
| Correct result (Win / Draw / Loss — ignoring score) | 3 |
| Exact scoreline (both goals correct) | 5 |
| **Maximum per group stage match** | **10** |

**No prediction submitted:** 0 points awarded with `no_prediction: true` in the breakdown. No row may exist, or the row may have NULL scores.

**Knockout match scoring (same rules, applied to 90-minute result):**

Extra time and penalties determine advancement but do not affect score-based prediction points. A match that ends 1-1 after 90 minutes (then decided on penalties) is scored as a 1-1 draw for prediction purposes. Knockout winner predictions use a separate points system.

**Knockout winner predictions (per round):**

| Round | Matches | Points per correct winner | Round max |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round of 32 | 16 | 5 | 80 |
| Round of 16 | 8 | 10 | 80 |
| Quarter-Finals | 4 | 15 | 60 |
| Semi-Finals | 2 | 20 | 40 |
| Third Place Play-off | 1 | 10 | 10 |
| Final | 1 | 25 | 25 |
| **Total knockout winner picks** | **32** | | **295** |

**Special predictions (awarded at tournament end):**

| Prediction | Points |
|---|---|
| Tournament Winner (pre-tournament) | 20 |
| Golden Boot (top scorer — free text) | 15 |
| Top Scoring Team | 10 |
| **Total specials** | **45** |

**Maximum possible points (theoretical):**
- Group stage: 72 matches × 10pts = **720**
- Knockout matches (score predictions): 32 matches × 10pts = **320**
- Knockout winner predictions: **295**
- Special predictions: **45**
- **Grand total: 1,380 points**

### 6.2 Per-Match Prediction Locking

Predictions lock automatically at each match's kickoff time. This is more fair than a single tournament-wide lock and maintains engagement throughout the six-week tournament.

**Lock flow:**
1. At application startup, APScheduler registers a `DateTrigger` lock job for every scheduled match keyed to `kickoff_utc`
2. When the job fires: `matches.status` → `locked`, `locked_at` is set
3. Any PUT to `/api/v1/predictions/{match_id}` after lock returns a `PREDICTION_LOCKED` error
4. Players who haven't predicted that match receive a `deadline_warning` push 1 hour before kickoff
5. Admin can manually lock a match early (e.g. if a game is moved up) via `POST /admin/matches/{id}/lock`

**Knockout round locking:**
- All knockout predictions for a given round lock at the kickoff of the first match in that round
- e.g. R32 predictions lock when the first R32 match kicks off

**Special predictions:**
- All special predictions lock at the kickoff of the opening match of the tournament

### 6.3 Group Standings

Live group standings are calculated dynamically from completed match results using FIFA tiebreaker rules:

1. Points (W=3, D=1, L=0)
2. Goal difference
3. Goals scored
4. Head-to-head points
5. Head-to-head goal difference
6. Head-to-head goals scored
7. Admin override (used as a manual tiebreaker for edge cases beyond the above — e.g. drawing of lots)

Standings displayed per group on the Groups page and as a compact widget on match cards. Admin override via `POST /admin/groups/{name}/override-standings` lets the admin pin team positions when automated tiebreakers can't resolve.

### 6.4 Knockout Bracket

The knockout bracket is built progressively as each round completes:

1. After group stage: admin reviews the 8 best third-placed teams, confirms the 32 advancing teams, and sets R32 matchups (following FIFA's predetermined bracket structure)
2. The app generates R32 match records via `POST /admin/knockout/advance`. Kickoff times are pulled from football-data.org during creation and admin confirms before saving
3. Players submit R32 winner predictions before the first R32 match kicks off
4. After R32: when all R32 matches have results, admin advances to R16 (same flow)
5. This process repeats through to the Final and Third Place Play-off

The bracket is displayed as an interactive visual tree showing all rounds from R32 to Final, with each player's predicted winner shown on their personal bracket view.

### 6.5 Special Predictions

Three pre-tournament predictions available to all players, submitted and locked before the opening match:

- **Tournament Winner** — which of the 48 teams wins the World Cup
- **Top Scoring Team** — which team scores the most goals across the tournament
- **Golden Boot** — free-text name of the player who scores the most goals

All three are visible to all players after the tournament starts (no hiding predictions from others post-lock). Points are manually awarded by admin at tournament end via `POST /admin/specials/award`.

### 6.6 Live Leaderboard

The leaderboard updates in near-real-time using Supabase Realtime. When a result is auto-fetched (or entered manually by admin), points are recalculated server-side within a transaction and broadcast to all connected clients — no admin action required during the tournament.

**Leaderboard displays:**
- Rank (with change indicator vs previous snapshot: ↑2, ↓1, ─)
- Player name and avatar colour
- Total points
- Points from current round (badge)
- Predictions submitted count vs total possible
- Expandable row showing breakdown (match pts / knockout winner pts / special pts)

**Removed players:** Soft-deleted players (`is_active = false`) are excluded from the active leaderboard but their predictions and snapshots are preserved. Their head-to-head records remain visible historically. An admin-only toggle can show "All players including removed" for reference.

**Leaderboard history:**
A line chart showing each player's rank over time, plotted per match result. Powered by `leaderboard_snapshots` aggregated by `snapshot_at` timestamp.

**Round leaderboard:**
Filter leaderboard to show only points earned in a specific round.

### 6.7 Head-to-Head Comparison

Any player can compare their predictions against any other player's on all completed matches. The comparison shows:

- Side-by-side predicted scores for every completed match
- Actual result
- Points each player earned per match
- Win/draw/loss record between the two players (whoever earned more points per match)
- Who predicted more exact scores, more correct results, more correct goals

Available as a dedicated page and as a quick-comparison overlay accessible from the leaderboard. Removed players can still be selected for historical comparison.

### 6.8 Player Stats

A per-player statistics page showing:

- **Overall accuracy** — % of matches with at least a correct result prediction
- **Exact score rate** — % of predictions that were exact
- **Average points per match**
- **Best round** — which stage earned the most points
- **Worst round** — which stage was worst
- **Current streak** — consecutive correct results
- **Best day** — single match day with highest points
- **Prediction timing** — how far in advance predictions are typically submitted
- **Head-to-head record** vs every other player

### 6.9 Match Schedule & Countdown

A full match schedule page organised by date, showing:

- Match date, kickoff time (converted to each player's local timezone)
- Teams and flags (or placeholder text for knockout matches)
- Venue and city
- Match status pill (Upcoming / Locked / Live / Completed / Postponed / Cancelled)
- Countdown timer to kickoff for upcoming matches
- Player's own prediction shown inline (or a prompt to predict if not yet submitted)
- Actual result once entered

Filterable by group, stage, date range, and team. Upcoming matches prominently surface the "predict now" CTA.

**Timezone handling:** All `kickoff_utc` values are stored in UTC. The frontend converts to the player's `profiles.timezone` (default UTC) using `date-fns-tz` for display. Matches span US/Canada/Mexico time zones, so timezone display matters.

### 6.10 Admin Result Entry

With auto-fetch in place, the admin results page is primarily a monitoring and override interface:

- **Auto-fetch status banner** — last sync time, next scheduled sync, error state
- **Manual trigger** — "Sync now" button for immediate fetch
- **Pending list** — completed matches where auto-fetch has not yet detected a result (rare)
- **Manual entry fallback** — for delayed/incorrect API
- **Source badges** — every entered result tagged "Auto" / "Manual" / "Override"
- **Override flow** — confirmation step + audit log entry; recalculates all points
- **Concurrency guard** — if the result changed while admin had the form open, a warning is shown and admin must explicitly proceed

### 6.11 Invite System

Admin generates invite links from the Admin panel:

1. Admin optionally pre-fills the player's name and sets an expiry (default 7 days)
2. A unique 64-char token is generated: `https://app.domain.com/join/{token}`
3. Admin copies and shares the link (WhatsApp, text, email)
4. Player visits the link, confirms or sets their display name (must be unique), creates a PIN
5. Token is marked as claimed; `notification_preferences` row created with defaults; player can log in
6. Admin is notified via push when an invite is accepted

Admin can see all invites (pending, claimed, expired) and revoke unused ones. Maximum 15 active players enforced at claim time.

### 6.12 Push Notifications

Push notifications are delivered via Web Push (VAPID) through the service worker. Players must grant notification permission when they install the PWA.

**Notification types:** see `notification_log.notification_type` ENUM in §3.13.

**Preferences and quiet hours** stored in `notification_preferences` (§3.12). When a player has `global_mute = true` or it's within their quiet hours, the notification is logged with `delivery_status = suppressed` rather than sent.

**Delivery failures:** A push that fails 3 consecutive times causes `push_subscriptions.is_active = false`. The player is shown an "Re-enable notifications" banner on next visit.

### 6.13 Match State Machine & Reschedule Handling

`matches.status` follows this state machine:

```
scheduled ──(kickoff time reached)──▶ locked ──(API: IN_PLAY)──▶ live ──(API: FINISHED)──▶ completed
    │
    ├──(admin or API: POSTPONED)──▶ postponed ──(reschedule)──▶ scheduled
    │
    └──(admin or API: CANCELLED)──▶ cancelled (terminal)
```

**Postponed matches:**
- Predictions remain saved (not voided)
- Match removed from leaderboard scoring (no points awarded)
- Push notification (`match_postponed`) to all players
- When rescheduled, kickoff_utc is updated and a new lock job is registered (see below)

**Cancelled matches:**
- Predictions are voided (no points awarded, no scoring)
- Push notification (`match_postponed` with cancellation message) to all players
- Match shown with strikethrough on the schedule

**Reschedule flow (kickoff change):**
1. Detected by auto-fetch comparing API `utcDate` against internal `kickoff_utc`
2. `original_kickoff_utc` set (if not already), `kickoff_utc` updated
3. Existing APScheduler lock job is cancelled
4. New lock job registered against the updated `kickoff_utc`
5. Push notification (`kickoff_changed`) to all players who have predicted that match
6. Audit log entry (`kickoff_changed`)
7. If the new kickoff is in the past (rare), match is locked immediately

### 6.14 Prediction Audit Trail

Every prediction submission and update is timestamped:

- `predictions.submitted_at` — set on first save
- `predictions.updated_at` — auto-updated on every change (standard convention)
- `predictions.update_count` — increments on every change

The audit trail is visible to admin (showing each player's prediction history per match) and provides proof against any disputes about whether a prediction was entered before or after kickoff. The system enforces locking server-side — no prediction can be saved if `match.status` is anything other than `scheduled`.

### 6.15 Backup & Restore

**Automated backups:** Supabase performs a daily snapshot of the database on the free tier (kept for 7 days). On Pro tier, point-in-time recovery is available.

**On-demand backups:** Admin can trigger a manual backup via `POST /admin/backup`, which runs `pg_dump` and uploads the compressed archive to Supabase Storage. Retained for 30 days.

**Restore procedure (documented in `docs/runbooks/restore.md`):**
1. Admin downloads the most recent backup archive
2. Spin up a fresh Supabase project (or restore in-place if Pro tier)
3. Apply the archive via `psql`
4. Restart the backend — APScheduler will re-register all lock jobs from the restored data
5. Verify via the admin dashboard

**Pre-tournament:** A backup is taken automatically the night before the opening match.

**Mid-tournament backups:** Daily automatic backups are sufficient for casual use. For peace of mind, admin can trigger one before any major operation (knockout advancement, result override).

## 7. Frontend Architecture & Design System

### 7.1 Design Principles

The app should feel **energetic, modern, and football-forward** — not a generic SaaS dashboard. Think sports data apps, not spreadsheets.

**Inspirations:** UEFA/FIFA tournament apps for structure and data density; FotMob for real-time match feel; Sofascore for stats layout; FPL (Fantasy Premier League) for leaderboard psychology.

**Core tenets:**

- **Tournament-first** — the match schedule and leaderboard are the beating heart; everything else supports them
- **Glanceable** — players should see their standing and next match prediction at a glance from any page
- **Live-feeling** — result notifications, rank changes, and score updates should feel instant
- **Mobile-primary** — most players will check scores on their phone; desktop is a second-class citizen
- **Competitive energy** — leaderboard rank changes, point breakdowns, and streaks should feel rewarding

### 7.2 Design System

**Colour Palette**

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| background | #0A0F1E | Page background (deep navy) |
| surface | #131929 | Cards, panels |

| gold | #FFD700 | 1st place, winner badges |
| silver | #C0C0C0 | 2nd place |
| bronze | #CD7F32 | 3rd place |
| success | #00E676 | Correct predictions, confirmations |
| warning | #FF9800 | Deadline warnings, attention |
| error | #FF4757 | Wrong predictions, errors |
| locked | #4A5A80 | Locked match indicator |
| live | #FF4757 | Live match pulsing indicator |

**Typography**

- **Display / Scores / Ranks:** Bebas Neue (bold, athletic, number-forward)
- **Headings / UI:** Outfit (clean, modern, excellent at all weights)
- **Mono / Timestamps:** JetBrains Mono (for kickoff times, scores)

**Motion**

- Leaderboard rank changes: animated position swap (300ms easeInOut)
- Points awarded: count-up animation on score reveal
- Match card lock: fade + blur transition
- Live indicator: pulsing red dot (CSS keyframes)
- Notification slide-in: from top, 250ms easeOut

### 7.4 Key Components

**Prediction Card:** Compact card per match showing home team, away team, two score inputs, lock status indicator, and points badge once result is in. Used on both /predictions and /schedule.

**Match Status Indicator:** Colour-coded pill — Upcoming (grey), Locked (orange padlock), Live (red pulse), Completed (green check), Postponed (amber dashed border), Cancelled (red strikethrough). Live status auto-updated by sync job.

**Leaderboard Row:** Rank number (Bebas Neue, coloured by medal), player name + avatar, total points (large), round points badge, trend arrow, expandable breakdown.

**Points Reveal:** When a result is detected (auto or manual), affected players' prediction cards animate to show earned points — count-up animation with colour-coded badge.

**Sync Status Widget:** Admin-only — shows last sync time, next sync countdown, and any error state.

**Bracket Tree:** Interactive SVG bracket showing all knockout rounds. Players' predictions overlaid in their avatar colour. Correct predictions highlighted in green after results.

**Countdown Timer:** Days/hours/minutes/seconds countdown to next match kickoff, respecting player's local timezone.

**Group Table:** Mini standings table per group — Team, P, W, D, L, GF, GA, GD, Pts. Updated live via Supabase Realtime.

### 7.5 State & Data Strategy

- **TanStack Query** manages all server state (caching, refetching, optimistic updates)
- **Zustand** for local UI state (modals, active filters, notification banners)
- **Supabase Realtime** subscriptions for live leaderboard and result updates
- **localStorage** for persistent user preferences and JWT tokens
- **Service Worker** for offline access to schedule and predictions

### 7.6 Mobile Gestures

- **Swipe left/right** on prediction cards to navigate between matches in a group
- **Pull to refresh** on leaderboard and schedule
- **Long press** on a player's leaderboard row to open head-to-head comparison
- **Haptic feedback** on prediction submission, result reveal, rank change

---

## 8. Authentication & Security

### 8.1 Authentication Flow

Players authenticate with a display name + 4–8 digit PIN. No email required.

**Token strategy:**
- **Access token:** JWT, 24-hour TTL, contains `player_id` and `role` claims, signed with HS256
- **Refresh token:** Opaque random string (32 bytes base64url), 30-day TTL, stored hashed (SHA-256) in `refresh_tokens` table
- Frontend stores both in `localStorage`; access token sent as Bearer header; refresh token used only against `POST /auth/refresh`
- 5 minutes before access token expiry, frontend silently calls `/auth/refresh` to get a new pair (refresh token rotated on every refresh)
- `POST /auth/logout` invalidates the current refresh token

**Join flow (invite):**
1. Player visits `/join/{token}`
2. Token validated server-side (active, unclaimed, not expired)
3. Player confirms or sets display name (must be unique); creates a PIN
4. Server creates `profiles` row, marks invite as claimed, creates `notification_preferences` row, issues JWT pair
5. JWT pair stored in `localStorage`

**Login flow:**
1. Player selects their name from a dropdown
2. Enters PIN
3. Server bcrypt-compares PIN hash; issues JWT pair on match
4. Failed attempts increment `profiles.failed_login_count`
5. 5 failed attempts within 15 min → `locked_until` set 15 min in future; further attempts return `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`
6. Successful login resets `failed_login_count` to 0

**Admin auth:**
Admin is a designated profile created via a one-time bootstrap script at setup. Admin role is checked on every admin endpoint before processing. Admin cannot be removed via the normal player removal endpoint.

### 8.2 Prediction Visibility Rules

To prevent prediction peeking before matches lock:

- Predictions for a match are **only visible to other players after that match locks** (`status` ∈ `locked`, `live`, `completed`)
- The admin can always see all predictions (needed for dispute resolution)
- A player can always see their own predictions at any time
- Cancelled matches show predictions as voided

This is enforced at the API level — `GET /api/v1/predictions/match/{id}` checks `match.status` before returning other players' data.

### 8.3 Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit |
|---|---|
| POST /auth/login | 5 attempts per 15 min per name+IP |
| POST /auth/join | 3 per hour per IP |
| POST /auth/refresh | 60 per hour per refresh token |
| PUT /auth/me/pin | 3 per hour per player |
| PUT /predictions/{match_id} | 60 per hour per player |
| PUT /knockout-predictions/{match_id} | 60 per hour per player |
| GET /leaderboard | 120 per minute per player (cached anyway) |
| POST /admin/sync/trigger | 10 per hour per admin |
| POST /admin/backup | 5 per day per admin |
| POST /notifications/test | 5 per hour per player |

### 8.4 Data Protection

- PIN never stored in plaintext — bcrypt with cost factor 12
- JWT access secret in `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` env var; rotated annually
- Refresh tokens hashed (SHA-256) before storage
- CORS configured: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to single frontend origin from `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` env var
- Security headers: HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy strict-origin
- All admin actions logged to `audit_log` with diffs
- No PII beyond display names — no emails, no personal data
- football-data.org API key, Supabase service key, VAPID private key all environment-only

---

## 9. Reliability & Operations

### 9.1 Match Lock Scheduler

APScheduler manages the automatic prediction locking. On application startup:

1. All matches with `status = scheduled` are queried
2. A `DateTrigger` job is registered per match, firing at `kickoff_utc`
3. Job sets `match.status = locked`, `locked_at = now()`, sends `match_locked` push to all players, sends `deadline_warning` 1hr earlier (separate scheduled job)
4. On application restart, jobs are re-registered for any future matches (idempotent)

**Startup reconciliation:** any matches where `kickoff_utc < now()` and `status = scheduled` are locked immediately.

**Reschedule support:** when `kickoff_utc` is updated (via auto-fetch detection or admin reschedule), the existing lock job is cancelled and a new one registered. See §6.13.

### 9.2 Auto Result Fetch Job

An `IntervalTrigger` job runs every 5 minutes:

1. Fetches all WC matches from football-data.org
2. Maps to internal records via `football_data_match_id`
3. For each, takes action based on status delta (see §5.1)
4. All write operations use row-level locks (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) for concurrency safety
5. Increments `consecutive_failure_count` on API error; pushes admin alert at 3
6. Updates `last_synced_at` for all checked matches
7. Idempotent — running twice with the same data produces no duplicate effects

### 9.3 Scoring Recalculation

Triggered identically whether result source is `auto`, `manual`, or `override`:

1. `matches` row updated with actual scores and `result_source` (within transaction)
2. Postgres function iterates all `predictions` for this match, calculates points (0 for no-prediction), updates `predictions.points_awarded` + `predictions.points_breakdown`
3. Same for `knockout_predictions` if applicable
4. Inserts `leaderboard_snapshots` for all players with updated totals
5. Transaction commits — Supabase Realtime broadcasts the updated leaderboard
6. Push notifications queued (respecting per-player preferences and quiet hours)

If a result is overridden, points are fully recalculated and snapshots updated. A correction entry is added to `audit_log`. Because the entire recalc happens in a single transaction, clients never see a partially-updated leaderboard.

### 9.4 Leaderboard Caching

The full leaderboard endpoint is cached per-request with a 30-second TTL in memory. Cache is invalidated on every result entry / override. For 15 players this is plenty; Realtime handles immediate updates.

### 9.5 Connection Pooling

SQLAlchemy async engine configured with:
- `pool_size = 10` — base connections held open
- `max_overflow = 10` — burst capacity
- `pool_pre_ping = True` — verify connection before use
- `pool_recycle = 1800` — recycle connections after 30 minutes (avoids stale connections in serverless environments)

### 9.6 Testing Strategy

**Backend (pytest):**
- Unit tests for scoring function — all edge cases including: exact, correct result, correct goals only, both wrong, 0-0 draw, no prediction (NULL), cancelled match
- Unit tests for lock scheduler registration + reschedule
- Unit tests for auto-fetch job: mocked API responses for FINISHED, IN_PLAY, SCHEDULED change, POSTPONED, CANCELLED, API failure, duplicate run, race with manual entry
- Unit tests for state machine transitions (valid + invalid)
- Integration tests for every API endpoint (happy path + locked match rejection + auth failure + role check)
- Minimum 80% line coverage

**Frontend (Vitest + React Testing Library):**
- Component tests for prediction card (editable / locked / postponed / cancelled states)
- Sync status widget tests (error state, success state, last-synced display)
- Leaderboard row tests (rank change animation state)
- Countdown timer tests (timezone correctness)

**End-to-end (Playwright):**
- Full player journey: join via invite → submit predictions → auto-fetch result fires → see points update
- Admin journey: verify auto-fetched result visible → override → verify recalculation
- Lock enforcement: attempt prediction after kickoff → verify rejection
- Postponement flow: API returns POSTPONED → match marked postponed → predictions preserved
- Reschedule: API returns new kickoff → new lock job registered → old job cancelled
- JWT refresh: access token expires → silent refresh → request continues seamlessly

### 9.7 CI/CD

GitHub Actions pipeline per PR:

1. Lint (ruff + ESLint + Prettier)
2. Type check (mypy + TypeScript)
3. Test (backend + frontend + E2E)
4. Build (frontend bundle + backend Docker image)
5. Migration check (Alembic applies cleanly forward + backward on a fresh DB)

On merge to `main` → auto-deploy to staging → manual promotion to production.

### 9.8 Observability

- **Sentry** captures exceptions on both ends; source maps uploaded on deploy
- **structlog** JSON logs with correlation IDs propagated through request lifecycle
- PII scrubbing — display names allowed, no other personal fields logged
- Health checks at `/health` (liveness) and `/health/ready` (DB + scheduler + football-data.org reachability)
- Slow query log enabled on Postgres at 500ms threshold

### 9.9 Operational Runbook

A `docs/runbooks/` directory contains:
- `restore.md` — restore from backup
- `kickoff-change.md` — handle a manual kickoff change
- `cancelled-match.md` — handle a cancelled match
- `pin-reset.md` — reset a player's PIN
- `auto-sync-broken.md` — what to do when football-data.org sync fails
- `tournament-end.md` — award special predictions, declare winner, archive

- Target uptime: 99.5% during tournament window (11 Jun – 19 Jul 2026)
- Match lock jobs must fire within 60 seconds of scheduled time
- Result entry never blocked by frontend failures (admin endpoints always available)
- Auto-fetch tolerates up to 1 hour of API outage before any user impact

### 10.3 Scalability

Designed for 15 players comfortably. Scales to 50 without architectural change. Beyond that would need caching layer and read replicas — out of scope.

### 10.4 Security & Privacy

- No PII beyond display names
- No tracking or analytics by default
- All PINs bcrypt-hashed (cost 12)
- Refresh tokens SHA-256 hashed
- OWASP Top 10 considered throughout

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | APScheduler misses a kickoff lock | Low | High | Startup reconciliation job; manual lock override in admin panel |
| 2 | Admin forgets to enter a result | Low | Low | **Mitigated by auto-fetch** — results entered automatically; admin only needed for overrides |
| 3 | Player disputes prediction was entered before lock | Low | Medium | Audit trail with server-side timestamps; prediction locked at server, not client |
| 4 | football-data.org API unreachable during a match window | Low | Medium | Admin fallback via manual entry UI; push alert after 3 consecutive failures; manual sync trigger |
| 5 | football-data.org returns incorrect score | Very Low | Medium | Admin override available; `result_source` field makes auto vs manual clear |
| 6 | Match postponed/cancelled mid-tournament | Medium | Medium | Defined state machine (§6.13); predictions preserved on postpone, voided on cancel; push notifications |
| 7 | FIFA changes a kickoff time | Medium | Medium | Auto-detected by sync job; lock job re-registered; players notified |
| 8 | Race between auto-fetch and manual override | Low | Low | Row-level locks (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`); UI warns admin if data changed since form open |
| 9 | Supabase Realtime drops connection | Medium | Low | TanStack Query polling fallback every 30s if Realtime disconnects |
| 10 | Push notifications not delivered on iOS | Medium | Low | In-app notification banner as fallback; player sees updates on next app open |
| 11 | Knockout bracket matchups unclear | Medium | Medium | Admin manually sets teams for each round; placeholder text shown until set |
| 12 | Player forgets their PIN | Medium | Low | Admin can reset any player's PIN from the admin panel |
| 13 | Supabase free tier limits hit | Low | Low | Monitor monthly; free tier generous for 15 players; fallback is £20/mo Pro |
| 14 | Single admin bus factor | Medium | High | Document admin flows; runbooks per operation; auto-fetch reduces admin burden |
| 15 | Database corruption / data loss | Very Low | High | Daily Supabase snapshots; on-demand backups; documented restore procedure |
| 16 | JWT secret leak | Very Low | High | Annual rotation; revoke all refresh tokens on rotation; audit log alerts |

## 16. Build Phases

### Session Protocol

**At the start of every session, print:**

```
=== PHASE [ID]: [NAME] ===
Model: [Sonnet 4.6 / Opus]
Status: [ ] Not started / [~] In progress / [✅] Complete

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] [criterion 1]
- [ ] [criterion 2]

Starting now.
```

**At the end of every session — phase close-out:**

Follow the global phase close-out protocol defined in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` exactly. Project-specific variables are declared in the repo's `CLAUDE.md`:

- Session log: `session-log.md` (repo root)
- Architecture/plan doc: `wc2026-architecture.md` (repo root)
- Remote: `origin main`
- CI: GitHub Actions — poll via GitHub API with token from env `GITHUB_TOKEN`

The close-out protocol handles: acceptance criteria sign-off, session log update, architecture doc sync, git commit + push, CI poll, and next phase declaration. A phase is **not complete** until the protocol finishes cleanly.

### Model Guide

| Tag | When to use |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Sonnet 4.6** | Straightforward implementation — CRUD, components, migrations, tests, API wiring. The default. |
| 🔴 **Opus** | Complex reasoning — scoring edge cases, bracket logic, scheduler design, realtime sync, debugging. |

### Stage 1 — Data & Tournament Seed

**Phase 1.1: Core Schema — Profiles, Refresh Tokens, Invites, Teams, Groups** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6 ✅ 2026-05-06
- Alembic initialised
- Migration for `profiles` (with `failed_login_count`, `locked_until`, `timezone`), `refresh_tokens`, `invites`, `teams` (with `eliminated_at_stage` ENUM and `football_data_team_id`), `groups`
- `updated_at` trigger helper applied
- **Acceptance:** Migrations apply and rollback cleanly

**Phase 1.2: Match Schema** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6 ✅ 2026-05-08
- Migration for `matches` with full state machine ENUM (scheduled, locked, live, completed, postponed, cancelled), `result_source` ENUM, `original_kickoff_utc`, `postponed_reason`
- UNIQUE constraint on `match_number` and `football_data_match_id`
- Indexes on `kickoff_utc`, `(stage, status)`, `football_data_match_id`
- **Acceptance:** Table exists; ENUM values enforced; indexes verified via `EXPLAIN`

**Phase 1.3: Prediction & Notification Schema** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- Migration for `predictions` (with `update_count` default 0), `knockout_predictions`, `special_predictions`
- Unique constraints on `(player_id, match_id)` and `(player_id, prediction_type)`
- Migration for `leaderboard_snapshots`, `push_subscriptions`, `notification_preferences`, `notification_log`, `audit_log` (with full ENUM lists)
- **Acceptance:** Full schema deployed; FKs enforced; default values verified; test data insertable

**Phase 1.4: Tournament Data Seed** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- Seed script inserts all 12 groups (A–L)
- Seed script inserts all 48 teams with flags, group assignment, `football_data_team_id`
- Seed script inserts all 72 group stage matches with kickoff times, venues, teams, `football_data_match_id`
- Idempotent (safe to re-run)
- **Acceptance:** After seed, all 72 group matches queryable with correct teams, kickoff times, and football-data IDs

**Phase 1.5: Scoring Function** 🔴 Opus
- Postgres function `calculate_match_points(predicted_home, predicted_away, actual_home, actual_away, stage)` returns JSONB breakdown
- Handles group stage rules (W/D/L for result; combined goals)
- Handles knockout score predictions (no draws — result is always W/L based on 90-min score)
- Returns 0 for NULL predictions with `no_prediction: true` flag
- Edge cases: 0-0 draw, same total goals different result, knockout draw at 90, NULL prediction
- Unit tests covering 25+ edge cases
- **Acceptance:** All test cases return correct points; function called within a transaction

**Phase 1.6: Scoring Trigger & Snapshot Insert** 🔴 Opus
- Postgres trigger on `matches` UPDATE: when scores set, calls scoring function for all predictions
- Updates `predictions.points_awarded` + `predictions.points_breakdown`
- Same for `knockout_predictions` (if knockout match)
- Inserts `leaderboard_snapshots` for all active players with updated totals
- All within a single transaction (atomic — clients never see partial updates)
- **Acceptance:** Entering a result via SQL updates all predictions and leaderboard atomically; concurrent reads never see partial state

---

### Stage 2 — Auth & Player Management

**Phase 2.1: Invite API** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `POST /api/v1/admin/invites` — create invite (optional name hint, expiry)
- `GET /api/v1/admin/invites` — list all
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/invites/{id}` — revoke
- Integration tests
- **Acceptance:** Admin creates invite; token is unique; deletion revokes access

**Phase 2.2: Join Flow API** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `POST /api/v1/auth/join` — validate token, check display_name uniqueness, create profile + notification_preferences row, issue JWT pair
- Enforce max 15 active players at claim time
- Mark invite as claimed
- **Acceptance:** Valid token creates player + default preferences; second use rejected; 16th player rejected; duplicate name rejected

**Phase 2.3: Login & Refresh API** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — name + PIN, return JWT pair, manage `failed_login_count` and `locked_until`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` — exchange refresh token for new pair (with rotation)
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/me/pin` — change own PIN (requires current PIN verification)
- `POST /api/v1/admin/players/{id}/reset-pin`
- **Acceptance:** Correct PIN returns JWT pair; wrong PIN increments counter; 5th fail locks for 15 min; refresh rotates token; logout invalidates

**Phase 2.4: Player API** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `GET /api/v1/players` — list active players (`is_active = true`)
- `GET /api/v1/players/{id}` — profile + stats stub (works for soft-deleted too, with flag)
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/players/{id}` — soft delete (`is_active = false`)
- **Acceptance:** Admin removes player; player can no longer log in; predictions and stats preserved historically; player hidden from default leaderboard

**Phase 2.5: Join & Login UI** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/join/{token}` page — name confirm + PIN creation form
- `/login` page — name dropdown + PIN entry
- Error states (locked account, invalid PIN, duplicate name)
- JWT pair stored, silent refresh wired up
- **Acceptance:** Full join flow works end-to-end; locked account shows lockout time; expired access token silently refreshes

**Phase 2.6: Admin Invite & Player UI** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/admin/invites` — generate, list, revoke
- `/admin/players` — list, remove, reset PIN
- Reset PIN flow returns a temporary PIN to admin (displayed once, copy to clipboard)
- **Acceptance:** Admin manages invites and players; reset PIN works; player can log in with temp PIN and change it

---

### Stage 3 — Matches & Schedule

**Phase 3.1: Match API** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `GET /api/v1/matches`, `/{id}`, `/upcoming`, `/live`, `/stage/{stage}`

**Phase 3.3: Match Schedule UI** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/schedule` page — matches grouped by date
- Match card component: teams, flags, kickoff time (player's IANA timezone via `date-fns-tz`), venue, full status pill set
- Countdown timer for upcoming matches
- Filter bar: by group, by stage, by date range, by team
- **Acceptance:** All 72 matches visible; filters work; countdown accurate to player's timezone; postponed/cancelled matches visually distinct

**Phase 3.4: Group Standings UI** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/groups` and `/groups/{name}` pages
- Supabase Realtime subscription — table updates when result entered
- **Acceptance:** Entering a test result in admin immediately updates the group table in another browser tab

**Phase 3.5: Match Lock Scheduler & Reschedule Handling** 🔴 Opus
- APScheduler integration in FastAPI startup
- On startup: register `DateTrigger` lock job for every scheduled match
- Lock job: sets `status = locked`, `locked_at = now()`, fires push
- Startup reconciliation for past-due scheduled matches
- Reschedule API (`PUT /admin/matches/{id}/reschedule`): updates `kickoff_utc`, sets `original_kickoff_utc`, cancels old lock job, registers new one, pushes `kickoff_changed`
- Postpone (`POST /admin/matches/{id}/postpone`) and cancel (`POST /admin/matches/{id}/cancel`) endpoints with state machine validation
- Unit tests for all transitions and reschedule scenarios
- **Acceptance:** Setting a match kickoff 5 seconds in future triggers lock at the right time; rescheduling re-registers the job; postponing preserves predictions; cancelling voids them

**Phase 4.4: Match Detail Page** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/matches/{id}` — all players' predictions in a comparison table (post-lock)
- Pre-lock: shows only own prediction + lock countdown
- Cancelled match: shows voided notice, no scoring
- **Acceptance:** Visibility rules enforced; cancelled state clear

---

- Triggers scoring pipeline identical to manual entry path
- Unit tests: new result, existing match update, race with manual, postponed detection, kickoff change detection, API failure
- **Acceptance:** Full status flow tested with mocked API; race condition handled correctly; reschedule triggers lock-job re-registration

**Phase 5.4: Admin Sync UI** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
- `/admin/sync` — sync status, last run time, next run countdown, error log
- "Sync Now" button
- Sync status widget on admin dashboard
- `/admin/results` updated to show source badges
- **Acceptance:** Admin sees last sync; manual trigger works; error state visible

**Phase 5.5: Points Reveal** 🟢 Sonnet 4.6
