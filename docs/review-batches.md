# Review batches (R1–R13)

Fixes from the 2026-05-18 pre-launch review, grouped to amortize the cold
system prompt: same-model adjacent, same files / conceptual area together,
shared helpers before their consumers. Each batch is one session, one PR.

Mark batches complete by striking through the row.

## R1 — Backend hardening 🟢 Sonnet · ~2 h

- **R1.1** `apps/api/src/config.py:11-12` — make `jwt_access_secret` and `jwt_refresh_secret` required (no default). Validator that rejects the literal placeholders `"change-me-access"` / `"change-me-refresh"` AND empty `vapid_private_key`, `supabase_service_key`, `football_data_api_key` when `environment != "development"`. App must refuse to start in prod with weak secrets. (~15 min)
- **R1.2** `apps/api/src/database.py:8-13` — add `pool_pre_ping=True, pool_recycle=1800` to `create_async_engine`. Matches spec §9.5. (~5 min)
- **R1.3** New `apps/api/src/middleware.py` (extend existing file) — `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` setting HSTS (`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. Register in `main.py:98` after the existing middleware. Skip HSTS when `environment == "development"`. (~30 min incl. test asserting headers present)
- **R1.4** Pydantic validators on auth + prediction schemas:
  - `auth.py` LoginRequest, JoinRequest, ChangePinRequest: `pin: str = Field(pattern=r"^\d{4,8}$")`, `display_name: str = Field(min_length=2, max_length=30, pattern=r"^[\w\s'\-]+$")`
  - `predictions.py` PredictionRequest: `predicted_home/predicted_away: int = Field(ge=0, le=20)`
  - Cover with test: each rejects invalid input with 422. (~45 min)
- **R1.5** `admin.py:57` — `expires_in_days: int | None = Field(default=7, ge=1, le=30)`. (~5 min)

**Acceptance:** `pytest apps/api/tests` green. New tests: bad-PIN rejected, bad-name rejected, negative score rejected, app refuses to start with placeholder JWT secret, security headers present on every response.

---

## R2 — Scoring integrity 🔴 Opus (extended thinking ON) · ~3 h

> **Decision (carried from review):** drop the `WHEN (OLD IS NULL...)` clause from the AFTER trigger so any update to scores re-fires scoring. Keep it on the BEFORE trigger so `result_entered_at` stays meaning "first entry time". This lets us delete the null-then-set hack from `override_result` and lets the trigger handle every recompute path.

- **R2.1** New migration `009_scoring_trigger_runs_on_every_update.py` — recreate the `matches_score_results` trigger without the `WHEN` clause:
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER matches_score_results
  AFTER UPDATE OF actual_home_score, actual_away_score ON matches
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION matches_score_results();
  ```
  Keep the BEFORE trigger unchanged. Downgrade restores the WHEN clause. (~20 min)
- **R2.2** `apps/api/src/routers/admin.py:635-645` — delete the null-then-set hack from `override_result`. Single-shot UPDATE now re-fires the trigger naturally. (~10 min)
- **R2.3** New `apps/api/src/services/leaderboard.py` — pure-Python `recompute_leaderboard_snapshot(session: AsyncSession, triggered_by_match_id: UUID | None) -> None` that inserts a fresh `leaderboard_snapshots` row per active player. Mirror the SUM(...) shape from `005_scoring_trigger.py:138-177`. Single source of truth for the non-trigger paths. (~45 min)
- **R2.4** Wire `recompute_leaderboard_snapshot` into:
  - `specials.py:award_specials` — after the bulk update, before the commit. **Critical:** without this the leaderboard is forever stale once the final is scored.
  - `admin.py:cancel_match` — after setting status, zero `predictions.points_awarded` and `knockout_predictions.points_awarded` for that match_id (single UPDATE each), then call the helper. Spec §6.13.
  (~45 min)
- **R2.5** Tests in `tests/test_specials.py` and `tests/test_admin_matches.py`:
  - After `award_specials`, latest snapshot per player has correct `special_points` and `total_points`.
  - After cancel of a previously-completed match, snapshot reflects zero contribution from that match.
  - Existing `test_override_recalculates_points` still passes (now via the simpler trigger path).
  - One new test: override the same result twice — final snapshot reflects the latest scores. (~60 min)

**Acceptance:** all existing scoring tests pass against new trigger; three new tests added; nothing in the codebase still calls the null-then-set pattern.

---

## R3 — Auth & rate limits 🟢 Sonnet · ~2.5 h

- **R3.1** New `apps/api/src/rate_limit.py` — single `limiter = Limiter(key_func=...)` instance + a `per_player_key(request)` helper that pulls `player_id` off `request.state` (set by a small dependency that decodes the bearer). Replace the two existing `Limiter(...)` calls in `main.py:77` and `auth.py:36` with imports. (~30 min)
- **R3.2** Apply spec §8.3 decorators:
  - `POST /auth/login` → `5/15 minutes` per `f"{display_name}:{get_remote_address(request)}"`
  - `POST /auth/join` → `3/hour` per IP
  - `POST /auth/refresh` → `60/hour` per refresh-token-hash
  - `PUT /auth/me/pin` → `3/hour` per player
  - `PUT /predictions/{match_id}` → `60/hour` per player
  - `PUT /knockout-predictions/{match_id}` → `60/hour` per player
  - `GET /leaderboard` → `120/minute` per player
  - `POST /admin/sync/trigger` → `10/hour` per player
  - `POST /admin/backup` → `5/day` per player
  - `POST /notifications/test` → `5/hour` per player
  (~45 min)
- **R3.3** `routers/auth.py:141-172` — fix login enumeration:
  - On no-player-found: still run `bcrypt.checkpw` against a fixed dummy hash so response time matches the real-player path.
  - On `locked_until` true: return same generic `401 "Invalid credentials"` (not `429`). Log `account_locked_attempt` server-side.
  - Keep the failed-attempt counter logic. (~30 min, includes test)
- **R3.4** `auth.py:117-119` `get_current_player` — add `Profile.is_active.is_(True)` to the WHERE clause so soft-disabled players can't authenticate. (~10 min, includes test)

**Acceptance:** all rate-limited endpoints return 429 after threshold (one test each, parameterised); response times for valid vs invalid login fall in same band (within ±20 %); inactive player gets 401 on `/auth/me`.

---

## R4 — Scheduler race + scoring-preview parity 🔴 Opus (extended thinking ON) · ~2 h

- **R4.1** `apps/api/src/scheduler.py:107-115` — drop the `lock_due_matches` interval from `minutes=1` to `seconds=15`. Confirm `max_instances=1, coalesce=True` are still set. (~5 min)
- **R4.2** Defence in depth — kickoff re-check inside the PUT handlers (the actual safety net; the scheduler is just an optimisation):
  - `routers/predictions.py:104` — additional check `if match.kickoff_utc <= _now(): raise 409 PREDICTION_LOCKED` regardless of `match.status`.
  - `routers/knockout_predictions.py` — equivalent in `upsert_knockout_prediction`.
  - `routers/specials.py:171` — already covered by `_is_locked`; just verify the helper compares against `_now()` not session start.
  - Test: monkeypatch a match's `kickoff_utc` to 1 s ago, with `status=scheduled`, assert PUT returns 409. Reasoning here is the race window: scheduler hasn't fired yet, status is stale, kickoff has passed — server must still refuse. (~45 min)
- **R4.3** `packages/shared/src/scoring.ts` — take `stage: 'group' | 'r32' | 'r16' | 'qf' | 'sf' | 'third_place' | 'final'` and exclude `correctResult` when `stage !== 'group'` AND (predicted draw OR actual draw). Mirror lines 99-103 of `migrations/versions/004_scoring_function.py` exactly. Update every caller (`apps/web/src/...` — grep for `scoreMatchPrediction`). Vitest cases: knockout draw-on-draw scores 7 not 10; knockout win-on-win unchanged. (~60 min)

**Acceptance:** new prediction tests pass; new Vitest cases pass; no caller of `scoreMatchPrediction` left without a stage argument.

---

## R5 — Frontend resilience 🟢 Sonnet · ~2 h

- **R5.1** `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts:10` and `contexts/AuthContext.tsx:4` — replace the `?? 'http://localhost:8000'` fallback with a module-load assertion: throw a clear `Error("VITE_API_URL is required in production builds")` when `import.meta.env.PROD && !import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`. Keep the localhost fallback only in dev. (~15 min)
- **R5.2** `apps/web/src/lib/tokens.ts:clearTokens` — also clear Workbox caches: `await caches.delete('api-user-data')` (and `'api-matches'` if you want a hard reset). `clearTokens` becomes async; update `AuthContext.logout` and `api.ts` retry path to `await` it. Test: after logout, `caches.has('api-user-data')` is false. (~30 min)
- **R5.3** `apps/web/src/hooks/useOfflineQueue.ts` — after `runFlush` returns, if `getQueueCount() > 0 && navigator.onLine`, schedule a retry with backoff (30 s → 60 s → 120 s, cap 5 min). Cancel on unmount or successful empty flush. Vitest: enqueue → flush succeeds for one entry, second entry added during flush, retry timer triggers second flush automatically. (~75 min)

**Acceptance:** production build with no env var fails fast at load; logout removes API caches; queue auto-replays even on a persistently-online session.

---

## R6 — Observability 🟢 Sonnet · ~2.5 h

- **R6.1** `migrations/versions/010_audit_log_action_types.py` — add `backup_failed` and `backup_downloaded` to the `audit_log.action_type` enum. (~15 min)
- **R6.2** `apps/api/src/scheduler.py:96-103` `run_scheduled_backup` — on exception, write an `AuditLog(action_type=backup_failed, actor_type=system, changes={"error": ...})` row and call a new `notify_backup_failed(db, reason)` (mirror `notify_auto_sync_failed`). Test: induced pg_dump failure produces both rows. (~45 min)
- **R6.3** `apps/api/src/routers/admin.py:download_backup` — write `AuditLog(action_type=backup_downloaded, actor_id=admin.id, changes={"filename": filename})` before returning the file. (~15 min)
- **R6.4** `apps/api/src/main.py:57` — `traces_sample_rate=0.0 if environment != "production" else 0.05`. (~5 min)
- **R6.5** Wrap each `await notify_*` call in `scheduler.py` and `services/result_sync.py` in `try/except Exception: log.exception(...)` so a failing push provider doesn't roll back the surrounding match update. (~30 min)
- **R6.6** Test: simulated push failure → match still committed, log line contains exception trace. (~30 min)

**Acceptance:** failing backup produces a push to admin + an audit row; downloading a backup produces an audit row; push provider raising never blocks scoring.

---

## R7 — Playwright smoke test 🟢 Sonnet · ~2.5 h

- **R7.1** Install `@playwright/test` in `apps/web`, scaffold `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`, write `apps/web/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`:
  1. Admin creates an invite via API (use a test bootstrap helper that seeds a known admin)
  2. Browser navigates to `/join/{token}`, submits name + PIN
  3. Browser PUTs a prediction for an upcoming seeded match
  4. Test helper advances `kickoff_utc` past now and waits for lock (or calls a `/test/lock-now/{match_id}` admin-only fixture endpoint)
  5. Admin posts a result via API
  6. Browser loads `/leaderboard`, asserts the test player has expected points
  
  Wire into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — depend on backend tests passing, run against a Docker-spun-up Postgres + the FastAPI app. (~2.5 h incl. CI wiring)

**Acceptance:** smoke test is green in CI on a fresh PR; failing it blocks merge.

## Deployment audit batches (R8–R10) — added 2026-05-30

Fixes from the 2026-05-30 deployment-setup audit (the "seamless, zero manual
back-and-forth" review). Same batching rationale as R1–R7: one session, one PR,
themed for review-ability. Each item notes its audit finding id (C/H/M/L) so you
can cross-reference the original report. **Some audit findings are dashboard/infra
actions, not code** — those are listed under *Operator actions* below and are
intentionally not R-rows (nothing to merge or close out).

| Batch | Model | Effort | Items | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~R8~~ | ~~🟢 Sonnet~~ | ~~R8.1–R8.5~~ | ✅ Shipped 2026-05-30 |
| ~~R9~~ | ~~🟢 Sonnet~~ | ~~R9.1~~ | ✅ Shipped 2026-05-30 |
| ~~R10~~ | ~~🟢 Sonnet~~ | ~~R10.1–R10.3~~ | ✅ Shipped 2026-05-30 |

Land **R8 first** — R9, R10, and the operator actions all reference the SHA
endpoint it adds.

---

## R8 — Deploy detection & fail-fast 🟢 Sonnet · ~3 h

> Why this batch exists: the audit's top finding (C2) is that the backend exposes
> no running-commit signal, so the incident that already happened — Railway serving
> a stale image while `/api/v1/health` returns 200 — is invisible to `/ship-prod`'s
> verification. This batch makes "is the new code actually live?" answerable, and
> makes a few near-misses fail fast instead of silently.

- **R8.1** (audit C2) `apps/api/src/config.py` + `apps/api/src/routers/health.py:12` — read the Railway-injected commit SHA into Settings (Railway provides `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` to the deploy env — **confirm the exact var name in the Railway dashboard before coding**; default `None`) and return it from `GET /api/v1/health` as `{"status":"ok","sha":<sha|"unknown">}`. Then in `.claude/commands/ship-prod.md` Step 3, after the health curl, assert the returned `sha` equals the just-pushed `main` HEAD SHA; if it differs or is `unknown`, fail the promotion with a clear "backend still serving a previous image — check the Railway source/branch trigger (Operator action OP2)" message. (~60 min)
- **R8.2** (audit L1) `apps/api/src/routers/health.py:17-25` — `GET /api/v1/health/ready` must return HTTP **503** (not 200) on the DB-unreachable branch, keeping the JSON body. Test: monkeypatch the session to raise, assert status 503 and `db:"unreachable"`. (~20 min)
- **R8.3** (audit M4, narrowed) `apps/api/src/config.py` — **extend the existing prod-config validator added in R1.1** (do not build a new one): when `environment == "production"`, also reject a `frontend_origin` that is empty or starts with `http://localhost`, and reject an empty `database_url`. R1.1 already covers the JWT/VAPID/Supabase/football-data secrets — only add the two it doesn't. Test: prod env + localhost origin → app refuses to start. (~25 min)
- **R8.4** (audit L2) `migrations/env.py` — set a short `lock_timeout` (e.g. `SET lock_timeout = '5s'`) on the migration connection in `run_migrations_online`, so a migrate-on-boot blocked on a lock fails fast instead of hanging toward the 300 s Railway healthcheck timeout. Transactional DDL still rolls back cleanly. (~20 min)
- **R8.5** (audit M1) `.claude/commands/ship-prod.md` Step 3 — add a post-deploy synthetic that goes through the deployed prod frontend origin to a real read-only API route (e.g. `/api/v1/matches/upcoming`) and asserts 2xx + expected shape, so a prod-only env/CORS mismatch (which a green staging run cannot catch) surfaces at promote time. Runs after R8.1's SHA gate. (~30 min)

**Acceptance:** `pytest` green incl. new health tests (503 on DB down; `sha` present in `/health`); the prod-config validator rejects a localhost `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in production with a test proving it; `ship-prod.md` documents the SHA assertion + synthetic as hard gates. No infra changes in this batch — branch protection etc. are Operator actions.

---

## R9 — CI runs the production frontend bundle 🟢 Sonnet · ~1.5 h

> Why: the `VITE_API_URL` hard-assert (shipped in R5.1) is gated on
> `import.meta.env.PROD`, and Playwright's webServer is `pnpm dev`
> (`apps/web/playwright.config.ts:23`), so the assert is dead in CI — a missing
> `VITE_API_URL` passes lint + build + e2e + smoke and only breaks in a real
> browser. This batch makes CI execute the prod bundle.

- **R9.1** (audit M2) `apps/web` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — add a CI step (or a dedicated Playwright project) that builds the web app in production mode (`vite build` with `VITE_API_URL` set to a dummy `https://` origin), serves it with `vite preview`, loads `/` headless, and asserts (a) no uncaught module-load error and (b) the served bundle references the configured API origin. Add a negative case: build with `VITE_API_URL` **unset**, load the page, and assert the R5.1 module-load throw fires (in a step allowed to fail, matching the thrown message) so the guard can't silently regress. Keep this separate from the existing dev-server `e2e`/`smoke` jobs. (~90 min)

**Acceptance:** CI has a job/step that loads the production-built bundle in a browser and goes red when `VITE_API_URL` is missing at build time; existing `e2e`/`smoke` jobs unchanged.

---

## R10 — Deploy docs reconciliation 🟢 Sonnet · ~1 h

> Doc-only, zero deploy risk — but incident-time-critical: today's runbook points
> operators at the wrong prod host and a deleted staging backend.

- **R10.1** (audit H2) `docs/runbooks/deploys-ongoing.md` — replace every `wc2026.vercel.app` with the canonical prod host `wc2026-prod.vercel.app` (lines 28, 41, 73, 94, 219) and the deleted `wc2026-api-production-333a.up.railway.app` with `wc2026-predictor-staging.up.railway.app` (line 44). Fix the rollback section and the local-deploy escape hatch so they target the real prod Vercel project. Cross-check against memory `reference_prod_urls.md` / `reference_staging_urls.md` (authoritative). (~30 min)
- **R10.2** (audit L3) Same file (or `CLAUDE.md`) — add a one-paragraph note that the backend assumes a **single Railway replica**: APScheduler jobs and migrate-on-boot have no leader election, so scaling to 2+ replicas would double-fire scheduled jobs and race on migrations. (~10 min)
- **R10.3** (audit M4, doc half) New `docs/runbooks/env-manifest.md` (or a table in `deploy.md`) — list every runtime var from `.env.example` and which surface owns it per env: Railway `production`/`staging` vs Vercel `wc2026-prod`/`wc2026-staging`, flagging the ones whose mismatch breaks prod silently (`VITE_API_URL`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SCHEDULER_ENABLED`). Reference it from `.env.example`. (~20 min)

**Acceptance:** `grep -rnE "wc2026\.vercel\.app|333a" docs/runbooks/deploys-ongoing.md` returns nothing; the single-replica assumption is written down; an env-var ownership manifest exists and `.env.example` links to it.

---

### Operator actions (no code — do these in the GitHub / Railway / Vercel dashboards)

Not R-batches: there is nothing to merge or close out, so they do not run through
`/ship-staging` or `/phase-closeout`. Tick them here when done.

- [x] **OP1** (audit H1) — GitHub branch protection enabled on `main` and `staging`: all 7 CI status checks required before merge. Done 2026-05-30.
- [x] **OP2** (audit C1) — Railway GitHub triggers verified: `production`→`main`, `staging`→`staging`, deploy-on-push enabled on both. Done 2026-05-30.
- [x] **OP3** (audit M3) — `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` confirmed on Railway staging env. Done 2026-05-30.
- [x] **OP4** (audit H2, infra half) — N/A: `wc2026.vercel.app` is not owned by this project. Canonical prod frontend is `wc2026-prod.vercel.app`; no action required.
- [x] **OP5** (audit L4) — `VERCEL_TOKEN` scoped and rotation confirmed. Done 2026-05-30.

## Soak code-audit batches (R11–R13) — added 2026-05-30

Fixes from the 2026-05-30 pre-soak re-audit (`docs/soak-review/code-audit-2026-05-30.md`),
triggered by multi-league reaching more people (the Lewis soak). Same batching rationale as
R1–R10; each item notes its audit finding id. **R11 is a hard BLOCKER — it gates handing
*staging* to Lewis, not just prod launch** (the public anon key is live-exploitable on
staging today). Empirically confirmed on a local full stack: backend suite 585 green, so
R12/R13 are isolation/clarity work on an otherwise-healthy backend.

| Batch | Model | Effort | Items | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~R11~~ | ~~🔴 Opus (extended thinking ON)~~ | ~~~3 h~~ | ~~R11.1–R11.4~~ | ✅ Shipped 2026-06-01 |
| R12 | 🟢 Sonnet | ~2.5 h | R12.1–R12.3 | Pending |
| R13 | 🟢 Sonnet | ~2 h | R13.1–R13.5 | Pending |

Land **R11 first** — it is the only item that gates the soak.

## R11 — Supabase RLS lockdown (C1) 🔴 Opus (extended thinking ON) · ~3 h

> Why this batch exists: RLS is **disabled on 13 PostgREST-exposed tables** and the public
> `anon` key (shipped in the JS bundle) holds full `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE` on
> every one of them (confirmed via `information_schema.role_table_grants` + `pg_class` +
> Supabase advisor on staging, and the prod data API returns HTTP 200 to the anon key).
> Anyone can read every player's predictions **pre-kickoff** (game-breaking) and rewrite or
> wipe predictions, leaderboards, memberships, and results — bypassing FastAPI. The frontend
> uses Supabase **only for realtime** (`.channel()` postgres_changes), never the REST data
> API, and all real writes go through FastAPI with the **service role** (which bypasses RLS),
> so this locks down with no loss of function — but realtime needs care.

The 13 exposed tables: `matches`, `predictions`, `knockout_predictions`, `special_predictions`,
`leaderboard_snapshots`, `leagues`, `league_memberships`, `league_join_requests`,
`push_subscriptions`, `notification_preferences`, `notification_log`, `audit_log`,
`alembic_version`. (`profiles`, `refresh_tokens`, `invites`, `groups`, `teams` already have RLS
— leave them.)

- **R11.1** (audit C1, kills the write vector) New Alembic migration — `REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER ON <each of the 13> FROM anon, authenticated`. The backend uses the service role (bypasses grants + RLS) so the app is unaffected. This alone removes the tamper/destroy capability. (~30 min)
- **R11.2** (audit C1, enable RLS) Same migration — `ALTER TABLE … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all 13. For the realtime-broadcast-safe tables the frontend subscribes to — `matches` and `leaderboard_snapshots` (fixtures + standings, non-secret) — add a minimal `SELECT` policy for `anon` + `authenticated` so realtime keeps flowing. The other 11 get RLS **with no policy** (deny-all). (~45 min)
- **R11.3** (audit C1, the game-integrity bit) **`predictions` / `knockout_predictions` must NOT be anon-readable pre-lock**, so they get **no** anon SELECT policy (deny-all). That ends their current realtime subscriptions, so update the pages that subscribe to them (the predictions / knockout pages) to drive refresh off the `matches` / `leaderboard_snapshots` channels (which fire when results are entered) + refetch predictions through FastAPI, which enforces the kickoff lock. Remove the direct `.channel()` subscriptions on the two prediction tables. (~60 min)
- **R11.4** (audit C1, verification — note: the anon-REST, realtime, and advisor checks are **Supabase-specific** and must run against a real Supabase project = **staging**; bare local Postgres has no PostgREST/Realtime). *Local* — `alembic upgrade head` + downgrade clean and `pytest` green (proves the migration applies and the service-role backend is unaffected). *Staging (after deploy)* — (a) with the staging anon key, `curl` the PostgREST endpoint: writes on the 13 tables return 401/permission-denied and pre-lock `predictions` reads return nothing; (b) leaderboard + match views still update live on result entry; (c) the Supabase advisor reports zero `rls_disabled_in_public`. (~30 min)

**Acceptance:**
- Migration enables RLS on all 13 tables and revokes anon/authenticated write grants; `alembic upgrade head` **and** downgrade run clean.
- With the public anon key, the PostgREST data API can no longer read pre-lock predictions or write/delete any of the 13 tables (curl evidence in the PR description).
- Supabase security advisor shows **no** `rls_disabled_in_public` findings.
- Realtime still works: leaderboard + match views update live on result entry (verified on **staging** — Realtime/PostgREST are Supabase-specific, not testable on bare local Postgres); `e2e`/`smoke` unchanged.
- `pytest` green (backend uses the service role — no behavioural change expected).

> **Operator follow-up (post-merge, before seeding prod):** the audit MCP was staging-bound, so re-run the Supabase advisor (or the `pg_class.relrowsecurity` query) directly on **prod** `kznxjyaanotrejcevngy` and confirm `rls_disabled_in_public` is clear there too.

## R12 — Backend tenant isolation 🟢 Sonnet · ~2.5 h

> Why: legacy single-pool read endpoints now leak across leagues, and players who leave a
> league linger on its leaderboard. Lower-stakes for a one-friend soak; matters for wider
> rollout. (H1 is read-only, post-lock only — not a scoring or write breach.)

- **R12.1** (audit H1) Scope the legacy global read endpoints to "requester shares ≥1 active league with target": `GET /predictions/match/{id}` (`routers/predictions.py:173` — filter returned rows to shared-league players), `GET /predictions/player/{id}` (:217), `GET /players/{id}` (`players.py:70`), `GET /players/{id}/predictions/recent` (:110), `GET /stats/{id}` (`stats.py:112`), `GET /specials/all` (`specials.py:223`). Add a shared-league helper dep; tests for the cross-league empty/403 path. (~90 min)
- **R12.2** (audit M2) `routers/leaderboard.py:83` `_leaderboard_entries` — join the snapshot read to current `league_memberships` (`player_id`, `league_id`, `deleted_at IS NULL`) so departed members drop off the board they left. Same fix for `_leaderboard_history` and the round leaderboard. Test: soft-delete a membership → player disappears from that league's board, keeps others. (~45 min)
- **R12.3** (audit M3) `GET /leagues/{slug}` — for a **private** league, don't return name/description/member_count to a non-member; return 404 (not 403, to avoid confirming existence). Public leagues unchanged. Test. (~20 min)

**Acceptance:** a member of League A can no longer read display names / stats / post-lock predictions of a player who shares no league with them; departed members vanish from the league board they left (test proves it); private-league metadata is not enumerable by slug; `pytest` green.

## R13 — Admin authority + hardening cleanup 🟢 Sonnet · ~2 h

- **R13.1** (audit M1) Unify site-admin authority: route both `require_admin` (`auth.py:181`) and the league `_is_superadmin` bypass (`routers/leagues.py`) through one source of truth (prefer `profiles.site_role`), or add a startup invariant that `role==admin` and `site_role==superadmin` never disagree. (~40 min)
- **R13.2** (audit M4) Replace the brittle `environment` string-match guard with an enum + fail-closed default (unknown value → behave as production → mount no `test_helpers`). (~30 min)
- **R13.3** (audit L1) Bound `leaderboard_snapshots` growth (the trigger inserts one row per active membership per result entry — unbounded): a scheduled prune keeping the latest N per (league, player) + dailies, or a documented cap. (~30 min)
- **R13.4** (audit L2) Delete the dead legacy `compare.router` — only `league_router` is mounted (`compare.py:281`). (~10 min)
- **R13.5** (audit L3) Confirm RANK vs DENSE_RANK is the intended leaderboard tie semantics; comment it, or switch to DENSE_RANK if gaps-after-ties are unwanted. (~15 min)

**Acceptance:** one admin-authority source of truth (or an invariant test); the `environment` guard fails closed on unknown values (test); snapshot growth is bounded; dead router gone; tie-semantics documented; `pytest` green.

## Notes on close-out

Each batch closes out the same way phase batches do: `/phase-closeout R<n>` after CI is green, append a short entry to `session-log.md`, strike the row above. Generate each batch's paste-prompt with `/next-batch-prompt review` — review mode reads this file directly (acceptance lives inline per `## R<N>` section), so no inline pasting is needed.
